        <p>Hello! My name is Gustavo, and I am a programming enthusiast, primarily focused on web development using the Vue.js framework. Currently, I am in the penultimate semester of my degree in Analysis and Systems Development, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself and my passion for software development.</p>
        <p>Throughout my learning journey, I have had the opportunity to explore different languages and technologies. Vue.js has become my primary language, and I have been fascinated by its intuitive and efficient approach to building interactive web interfaces. In addition to Vue.js, I have acquired knowledge in other popular tools such as React, Flutter, JavaScript, and C#.</p>
        <p>During my internship, I had the chance to apply my skills to practical projects, working with Vue.js, Flutter, Dart, and JavaScript. These experiences provided me with a rich learning environment where I could enhance my problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills.</p>
        <p>I am always striving for continuous improvement and expanding my knowledge in web development and related areas. I dedicate time to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and innovations in the technology world by participating in developer communities, reading articles, and working on personal projects.</p>
        <p>Apart from my passion for programming, I strongly believe in the power of collaboration. I think the best way to achieve exceptional results is through teamwork, sharing knowledge and ideas. I am proactive and always willing to assist my teammates, contributing my technical skills and adaptability.</p>
        <p>I am excited about the possibilities that programming offers and how we can positively impact people's lives through technology. If you are looking for a developer who is passionate about Vue.js while also having knowledge in other relevant technologies, I am ready to take on challenges and collaborate on exciting projects.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to being part of an innovative team where we can create creative and inspiring solutions together. Let's build a bright technological future!</p>
